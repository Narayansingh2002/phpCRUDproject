# phpCRUDproject
This is a basic project to practice and enhance my PHP and MySQL skills. The tech stack i used was HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, phpMyAdmin and set up locally using XAMPP. This web app allows the user to add data with a form, and can update and delete data on the "Admin" page, which then the user can view all available records on the "View data" page.
